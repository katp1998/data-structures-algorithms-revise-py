This is where I brush up my basic concepts on programming 
-- to be a better HUMAN programmer!
-----------------------------------
F*ck AI! I am smart!!
-----------------------------------

Stuff that will be covered through this:
1. Data Structures:
    - arrays/strings
    - linked lists - doubly/singly, linked, reversal, cycle detection
    - stacks/queues
    - hash maps/sets
    - trees - binary, BST operations, AVL basics, n-ary trees, trie (prefix tree), segment tree (basic), BFS/DFS traversals, LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)
    - heaps/priority queues - min-heap, max-heap, top-K problems, heap sort, two-heap pattern
    - graphs - adjacency list + matrix, directed/undirected, weighted, BFS, DFS, topological sort, union-find (DSU), Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Prim's & Kruskal's (basics)
    - [opt] LRU cache (hashMap + doubly linked list), monotonic deque

2. Algorithms (with space + time complexities):
    - sorts:
        - merge
        - quick
        - heap
        - counting
    - searches: 
        - binary
        - linear
        - breath-first (BFS)
        - depth-first (DFS)
    - recursion/backtracking 
    - DP
    - weighters:
        - dijkstra’s
        - A*

3. Problem Patterns:
    - sliding window
    - two pointers
    - fast and slow pointer
    - binary search
    - BFS for shortest path
    - topological sort
    - union-find
    - monotonic stack/deque
    - interval merging
    - matrix as graph
    - prefix sum/difference array
    - dp on trees/graphs
    - divide and conquer on arrays
